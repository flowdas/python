<h2>소프트웨어의 역사<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-the-software" title="제목 주소">¶</a></h2>
<p>파이썬은 ABC라는 언어의 후계자로서 네덜란드의 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cwi.nl/">https://www.cwi.nl/</a> 참조)의 Guido van Rossum에 의해 1990년대 초반에 만들어졌습니다. 파이썬에는 다른 사람들의 많은 공헌이 포함되었지만, Guido는 파이썬의 주요 저자로 남아 있습니다.</p>
<p>1995년, Guido는 Virginia의 Reston에 있는 Corporation for National Research Initiatives(CNRI, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/">https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/</a> 참조)에서 파이썬 작업을 계속했고, 이곳에서 여러 버전의 소프트웨어를 출시했습니다.</p>
<p>2000년 5월, Guido와 파이썬 핵심 개발팀은 BeOpen.com으로 옮겨서 BeOpen PythonLabs 팀을 구성했습니다. 같은 해 10월, PythonLabs 팀은 Digital Creations(현재 Zope Corporation; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zope.com/">http://www.zope.com/</a> 참조)로 옮겼습니다. 2001 년, 파이썬 소프트웨어 재단(PSF, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/">https://www.python.org/psf/</a> 참조)이 설립되었습니다. 이 단체는 파이썬 관련 지적 재산권을 소유하도록 특별히 설립된 비영리 조직입니다. Zope Corporation은 PSF의 후원 회원입니다.</p>
<p>모든 파이썬 배포판은 공개 소스입니다 (공개 소스 정의에 대해서는 <a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.org">https://opensource.org</a>/를 참조하십시오). 역사적으로, 대부분 (하지만 전부는 아닙니다) 파이썬 배포판은 GPL과 호환됩니다; 아래의 표는 다양한 배포판을 요약한 것입니다.</p>
